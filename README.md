# Repository Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files that focus on **[insert main topics or themes of the notebooks]**. Each notebook is designed to **[explain the purpose, e.g., analyze data, demonstrate a machine learning model, etc.]**.

## Notebook 1: [Exploratory Data Analysis on Customer and Transaction Data]

### Objective
**[The objective of this EDA notebook is to explore the retail dataset, understand its features, clean and preprocess the data, and visualize key trends and relationships among variables to generate insights that can inform strategic decisions.]**

### Key Features
- **Feature 1**: [e.g., Data cleaning and preprocessing steps]
- **Feature 2**: [e.g., Visualization techniques used]

### Results
**[Sales have mainly been due to Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream retirees shoppers. We found that the high spend in chips for mainstream young singles/couples and retirees is due to there being more of them than other buyers. Mainstream, midage and young singles and couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behaviour. We’ve also found that Mainstream young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population. The Category Manager may want to increase the category’s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibilty and impulse behaviour.]**

## Notebook 2: [Retail Strategy]

### Objective
**[The objective of this second notebook is to implement statistical methods to analyze the retail dataset, focusing on hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis to derive insights that can guide strategic decisions in retail management.]**

### Key Features
- **Feature 1**: [e.g., Statistical analysis performed]
- **Feature 2**: [e.g., Comparison of different models]
- **Feature 3**: [e.g., Insights derived from data visualization]

### Results
**[In this task, we found that the results for trial stores 77 and 86 showed a statistically significant difference in at least two stores of the three months of the trial period. However, this was not the case for store 88. We can check to see if the trial was implemented differently in store 88 but even so, we have been able to see that the trial has resulted in a significant increase in sales.]**

## Conclusion
These notebooks serve as a comprehensive resource for data scientists, students, and analysts. They demonstrate practical applications of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as various data analysis techniques, contributing to the understanding of retail analytics and exploratory data analysis. By leveraging statistical methods and machine learning models, users can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and sales trends, ultimately aiding in strategic decision-making within the retail sector.**.
